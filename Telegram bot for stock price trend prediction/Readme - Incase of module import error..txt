For any compatibility issues:

Any or all missing modules can be installed with pip install 'module_name'.

However, I used an older version of python-telegram-bot, as there are more resources available for debugging. Current version is in the 20 series, but the methods and functions have been changed.

Incase of any issues with running methods or importing modules from telegram / telegram-bot, make sure to downgrade or reinstall the requied version with below command :

!pip install python-telegram-bot==12.8
